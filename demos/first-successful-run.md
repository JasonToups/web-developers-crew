Wireframes:

The wireframes for the landing page include a header, navigation menu, call-to-action buttons, and a footer. The header features an intuitive logo design that is easy to navigate. The navigation menu includes options for browsing books, reading recommendations, and user profiles. The call-to-action buttons are prominent and clear in their messaging, encouraging users to explore the product offerings.

The visual design elements for the landing page include a clean and modern color scheme, typography, and illustrations that align with the brand's aesthetic. The typography is easy to read and provides clear instructions for users. The color scheme is adaptable and consistent throughout the page, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

Responsive Layout Details:

The responsive layout details for the landing page include media queries that adjust the design based on screen size. This ensures that the content remains visible and accessible to users, regardless of their device or screen resolution. The layout is adaptable and fluid, allowing users to easily navigate the site without any issues.

* Call-to-Action Buttons: Use call-to-action buttons to highlight key features and encourage users to take action. These buttons should be prominent, clear in their messaging, and consistent throughout the site.
* Footer: Use a footer component to include essential links, legal information, and social media handles. The footer should be consistent throughout the site and provide easy access to important information and resources.

Conclusion:
